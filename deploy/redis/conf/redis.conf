################################# REPLICATION #################################
 
# 主从复制。使用slaveof从 Redis服务器复制一个Redis实例。注意，该配置仅限于当前slave有效
# so for example it is possible to configure the slave to save the DB with a
# different interval, or to listen to another port, and so on.
# 设置当本机为slav服务时，设置master服务的ip地址及端口，在Redis启动时，它会自动从master进行数据同步
# slaveof <masterip> <masterport>
 
 
# 当master服务设置了密码保护时，slav服务连接master的密码
# 下文的“requirepass”配置项可以指定密码
# masterauth <master-password>
 
# When a slave lost the connection with the master, or when the replication
# is still in progress, the slave can act in two different ways:
#
# 1) if slave-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the slave will
#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of data data, or the
#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
#
# 2) if slave-serve-stale data is set to 'no' the slave will reply with
#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
#    but to INFO and SLAVEOF.
#
slave-serve-stale-data yes
 
# Slaves send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change
# this interval with the repl_ping_slave_period option. The default value is 10
# seconds.
#
# repl-ping-slave-period 10
 
# The following option sets a timeout for both Bulk transfer I/O timeout and
# master data or ping response timeout. The default value is 60 seconds.
#
# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
# specified for repl-ping-slave-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
# every time there is low traffic between the master and the slave.
#
# repl-timeout 60
 
################################## SECURITY ###################################
 
# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to
# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should

# 设置Redis连接密码，如果配置了连接密码，客户端在连接Redis时需要通过auth <password>命令提供密码，默认关闭
# requirepass 123456
# Command renaming.
#
# It is possilbe to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared
# environment. For instance the CONFIG command may be renamed into something
# of hard to guess so that it will be still available for internal-use
# tools but not available for general clients.
#
# Example:
#
# rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52
#
# It is also possilbe to completely kill a command renaming it into
# an empty string:
#
# rename-command CONFIG ""
 
################################### LIMITS ####################################
 
# 设置同一时间最大客户端连接数，默认无限制，Redis可以同时打开的客户端连接数为Redis进程可以打开的最大文件描述符数，
# 如果设置maxclients 0，表示不作限制。当客户端连接数到达限制时，Redis会关闭新的连接并向客户端返回max Number of clients reached错误信息
# maxclients 128
 
# Don't use more memory than the specified amount of bytes.
# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys with an
# EXPIRE set. It will try to start freeing keys that are going to expire
# in little time and preserve keys with a longer time to live.
# Redis will also try to remove objects from free lists if possible.
#
# If all this fails, Redis will start to reply with errors to commands
# that will use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
# to reply to most read-only commands like GET.
#
# WARNING: maxmemory can be a good idea mainly if you want to use Redis as a
# 'state' server or cache, not as a real DB. When Redis is used as a real
# database the memory usage will grow over the weeks, it will be obvious if
# it is going to use too much memory in the long run, and you'll have the time
# to upgrade. With maxmemory after the limit is reached you'll start to get
# errors for write operations, and this may even lead to DB inconsistency.
# 指定Redis最大内存限制，Redis在启动时会把数据加载到内存中，达到最大内存后，Redis会先尝试清除已到期或即将到期的Key，
# 当此方法处理后，仍然到达最大内存设置，将无法再进行写入操作，但仍然可以进行读取操作。
# Redis新的vm机制，会把Key存放内存，Value会存放在swap区
# maxmemory <bytes>
 
# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
# is reached? You can select among five behavior:
#
# volatile-lru -> remove the key with an expire set using an LRU algorithm
# allkeys-lru -> remove any key accordingly to the LRU algorithm
# volatile-random -> remove a random key with an expire set
# allkeys->random -> remove a random key, any key
# volatile-ttl -> remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction -> don't expire at all, just return an error on write operations
#
# Note: with all the kind of policies, Redis will return an error on write
#       operations, when there are not suitable keys for eviction.
#
#       At the date of writing this commands are: set setnx setex append
#       incr decr rpush lpush rpushx lpushx linsert lset rpoplpush sadd
#       sinter sinterstore sunion sunionstore sdiff sdiffstore zadd zincrby
#       zunionstore zinterstore hset hsetnx hmset hincrby incrby decrby
#       getset mset msetnx exec sort
#
# The default is:
#
# maxmemory-policy volatile-lru
 
# LRU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can select as well the sample
# size to check. For instance for default Redis will check three keys and
# pick the one that was used less recently, you can change the sample size
# using the following configuration directive.
#
# maxmemory-samples 3
 
############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################
 
#
# Note that you can have both the async dumps and the append only file if you
# like (you have to comment the "save" statements above to disable the dumps).
# Still if append only mode is enabled Redis will load the data from the
# log file at startup ignoring the dump.rdb file.
# 指定是否在每次更新操作后进行日志记录，Redis在默认情况下是异步的把数据写入磁盘，如果不开启，可能会在断电时导致一段时间内的数据丢失。
# 因为redis本身同步数据文件是按上面save条件来同步的，所以有的数据会在一段时间内只存在于内存中。默认为no
# IMPORTANT: Check the BGREWRITEAOF to check how to rewrite the append
# log file in background when it gets too big.
 
appendonly yes
 
# 指定更新日志文件名，默认为appendonly.aof
# appendfilename appendonly.aof
 
# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead to wait for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
 
# 指定更新日志条件，共有3个可选值：
# no:表示等操作系统进行数据缓存同步到磁盘（快）
# always:表示每次更新操作后手动调用fsync()将数据写到磁盘（慢，安全）
# everysec:表示每秒同步一次（折衷，默认值）
 
appendfsync everysec
# appendfsync no
 
# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
# our synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving the durability of Redis is
# the same as "appendfsync none", that in pratical terms means that it is
# possible to lost up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
# default Linux settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.
no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no
 
# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size will growth by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (or if no rewrite happened since the restart, the size of
# the AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
# is reached but it is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a precentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
# rewrite feature.
 
auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100

################################## SLOW LOG ###################################
 
# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
# other requests in the meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
# queue of logged commands.
 
# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000
 
# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.

################################ VIRTUAL MEMORY ###############################
 
### WARNING! Virtual Memory is deprecated in Redis 2.4
### The use of Virtual Memory is strongly discouraged.
 
### WARNING! Virtual Memory is deprecated in Redis 2.4
### The use of Virtual Memory is strongly discouraged.
 
# Virtual Memory allows Redis to work with datasets bigger than the actual
# amount of RAM needed to hold the whole dataset in memory.
# In order to do so very used keys are taken in memory while the other keys
# are swapped into a swap file, similarly to what operating systems do
# with memory pages.
# 指定是否启用虚拟内存机制，默认值为no，
# VM机制将数据分页存放，由Redis将访问量较少的页即冷数据swap到磁盘上，访问多的页面由磁盘自动换出到内存中
# 把vm-enabled设置为yes，根据需要设置好接下来的三个VM参数，就可以启动VM了
# vm-enabled no
# vm-enabled yes
 
# This is the path of the Redis swap file. As you can guess, swap files
# can't be shared by different Redis instances, so make sure to use a swap
# file for every redis process you are running. Redis will complain if the
# swap file is already in use.
#
# Redis交换文件最好的存储是SSD（固态硬盘）
# 虚拟内存文件路径，默认值为/tmp/redis.swap，不可多个Redis实例共享
# *** WARNING *** if you are using a shared hosting the default of putting
# the swap file under /tmp is not secure. Create a dir with access granted
# only to Redis user and configure Redis to create the swap file there.
# vm-swap-file /tmp/redis.swap
 
# With vm-max-memory 0 the system will swap everything it can. Not a good
# default, just specify the max amount of RAM you can in bytes, but it's
# better to leave some margin. For instance specify an amount of RAM
# that's more or less between 60 and 80% of your free RAM.
# 将所有大于vm-max-memory的数据存入虚拟内存，无论vm-max-memory设置多少，所有索引数据都是内存存储的（Redis的索引数据就是keys）
# 也就是说当vm-max-memory设置为0的时候，其实是所有value都存在于磁盘。默认值为0
# vm-max-memory 0
 
# Redis swap文件分成了很多的page，一个对象可以保存在多个page上面，但一个page上不能被多个对象共享，vm-page-size是要根据存储的数据大小来设定的。
# 建议如果存储很多小对象，page大小最后设置为32或64bytes；如果存储很大的对象，则可以使用更大的page，如果不确定，就使用默认值
# vm-page-size 32
 
# 设置swap文件中的page数量由于页表（一种表示页面空闲或使用的bitmap）是存放在内存中的，在磁盘上每8个pages将消耗1byte的内存
# swap空间总容量为 vm-page-size * vm-pages
#
# With the default of 32-bytes memory pages and 134217728 pages Redis will
# use a 4 GB swap file, that will use 16 MB of RAM for the page table.
#
# It's better to use the smallest acceptable value for your application,
# but the default is large in order to work in most conditions.
# vm-pages 134217728
 
# Max number of VM I/O threads running at the same time.
# This threads are used to read/write data from/to swap file, since they
# also encode and decode objects from disk to memory or the reverse, a bigger
# number of threads can help with big objects even if they can't help with
# I/O itself as the physical device may not be able to couple with many
# reads/writes operations at the same time.
# 设置访问swap文件的I/O线程数，最后不要超过机器的核数，如果设置为0，那么所有对swap文件的操作都是串行的，可能会造成比较长时间的延迟，默认值为4
# vm-max-threads 4

# you are under the following limits:
list-max-ziplist-entries 512
list-max-ziplist-value 64
 
# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed
# of just strings that happens to be integers in radix 10 in the range
# of 64 bit signed integers.
# The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the
# set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.

# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in
# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level
# keys to values). The hash table implementation redis uses (see dict.c)
# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into an hash table
# that is rhashing, the more rehashing "steps" are performed, so if the
# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used
# by the hash table.
#
# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
# active rehashing the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.
#
# If unsure:
# use "activerehashing no" if you have hard latency requirements and it is
# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply form time to time
# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.
# 指定是否激活重置哈希，默认为开启
